- Internet (Client & Server)

	A very large wired (undersea) computer network.
	Client: consume services; usually personal computers.
	Server: offer services (web applications, storage, APIs...); usually high-performance (based on specialization e.g. web application or file storage) computers - but can be any, even locally; accessed via IP (Internet Protocol) address.
	Warning! Some companies offer servers as a service (e.g. Amazon or Microsoft Azure); some companies hire them - rent - and others manage their own.
	Flow:
	
		Find server IP address: Client - server alias > IPS (Internet Service Provider) - server alias > DNS server - server IP address > IPS - server IP address > Client
		Client/Server request: Client - request > Server - response > Client

- Web application

	Application consisting of code written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language - content or structure), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet - appearance) and JS (JavaScript - functionality or behavior) - Warning! Separation of concerns.
	The only required file type is HTML (because in the very beginnig of the Internet only HTML existed; it is possible to embed CSS and JS code in HTML files).
	Hosted in a server: locally (development) or remotelly (production). Warning! A server is not required for local hosting while not backend code needs to be executed.
	
		Custom server
		Rental server
		GitHub Pages
	
	Code is sent to the client from the server under request so it can be processed (and so rendered) by the browser.
	Project file structure:
	
		"index.html" file: home page (main HTML file).
		"assets" folder: contain resources such as images, audio, or video (organized in corresponding subfolders).
		"public" folder: contain static files.

- Filepath

	Path to a file or a folder location.
	Absolute (from root) vs. Relative (from current location; common in web development).
	Special characters:
	
		Go up a level (parent directory): "../"
		Current directory: "./" (can be ommited, but sometimes fails)
