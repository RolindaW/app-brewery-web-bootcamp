- API

	Application
	Programming Interface: bridge the communication between two pieces of software by some rule or protocol definition.
	
	Specify how to make the request and how the response is going to be given.
	Popular architectures: GraphQL, SOAP, REST (most popular among web development; use HTTP protocol to interact with the API), gRPC.
	Public (external use; expose specific features; well documented) vs. private (internal use e.g. between web application frontend and backend).
	Response is most commonly formatted in JSON - Warning! It can be provided in multiple sockets so it needs to be rebuilt before processing.

- API Structure

	API Endpoint: a FIXED route on the API provider server (e.g. "base-url/endpoint"; begin after the base URL, separated by forward-slash "/" symbol); used to define different purposes of the API.
	Query parameter: additional info about the query (e.g. "base-url/endpoint?query:value"; begin after the endpoint, separated by question-mark "?" symbol; allow multiple key-value pairs separated by ampersand "&" symbol); used for filtering and searching.
	Path parameter: a NON-FIXED parameter (e.g. "base-url/endpoint/path-parameter"; begin after the endpoint, separated by forward-slash "/" symbol); used to represent an specific resource (e.g. id, username).
	Body: the content of the request (e.g. a document - in the form of a byte array - to be loaded into the server).

- JSON

	JavaScript Object Notation: JS object is just serialized (so similar syntax) so later parsing within JS is immediate.
	Allow to send data in a readable (altough using a JSON visualizer is recommended) but also efficient way.

- Authentication

	Protect resources behind the API by granting access only to authorized individuals.
	Authentication (grant access to a registered - by username/password pair or token - user) vs. Authorization (grant access to a permitted - by key - client - i.e. non-registered user).
	Token (issued by the API provider under demand for a registered user) vs. Key (issued by the API provider once for a client)
	Authorization header: a type of request header containing authentication information; use "Authorization" header key; usually only one per request.
	
	Tiers - Warning! Encrypting sensitive data during communication (e.g a password) is a must in terms of security.
	No authetication (No Auth): optionally add a rate limit (measured in RPS - Requests Per Second; identified by IP address) as a safety check to prevent API abuse; recommended when NOT handling changing data that needs to be protected or data that needs to be assigned to a specific user.
	Basic authentication (Basic Auth): provide username and password (commonly as a Base64 encoded string) in the authorization header; use "Basic encoded-user-pwd-str" header value.
	API-key-based authorization (API Key): provide a client key either in a specific header (use the key name and value as the header key and value, respectively) or as a query parameter.
	Token-based authentication (OAuth / OAuth 2.0 - standard; e.g. Bearer Token): provide a user token in the authorization header; use "token-type-name token-value" header value.
