# Personal Website

A personal website about myself, where I expose my professional skills and interests and provide contact information.

## Design

### Colors

Use a color palette that conveys a friendly and pleasant feeling, as well as elegant and professional. The base color of my color palette is pink. I use two different shades of pink and the rest of the colors are light (white - or rather close to it, yellow, blue, gray). For fonts I use a gray range instead of the classic black.

Color base 1: #FF9EAA (dark pink)
Color base 2: #FFD0D0 (light pink)
Color bright 1: #F9F9E0 (light cream)
Color dark: #3AA6B9 (green turqoise)
Color dark 2: #40514E (dark gray)

### Fonts

I use a maximum of two sources. They are opposite type fonts, with opposite purpose of use. I use different weight levels depending on the purpose. I also use different levels of spacing between characters depending on the case. Following the color palette approach, I have chosen fonts balanced in terms of seriousness and casualness.

### UI

The user interface design is clear and simple. It includes as little content as possible. It respects the same alignment pattern throughout the document to make reading pleasant for the user.

The structure of the page is divided as follows: header (decorator), hero with a brief description of myself, a 2D grid with my skills, a 1D grid with my interests and a footer with contact information.

The following sections share the same background color in order to visually convey the structure of the page: header and footer (one shade of pink); hero and interests share (light shade - variation of white); skills (another different shade of pink).

### UX

The design of the user experience is based on using a website architecture with a single page so that navigation is as comfortable as possible (vertical scroll). The application adapts to different screen widths to cover the two most common device types: mobile and desktop.
